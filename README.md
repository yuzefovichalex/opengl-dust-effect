# OpenGL Dust Effect

![OpenGL Dust Effect](art/banner.png)

A project to demonstrate the implementation of the UI-element "disintegration" effect (aka "Thanos"/Dust) on different platforms (Android, Web) using OpenGL. The project is not a library, but only demonstrates one of the possible solutions in educational purposes. You can find a more detailed description for each of the supported platforms in its own README ([Android](android/README.md), [Web](web/README.md)).
